# Assignment Problem Statement:
## 1. Build a numpy MNIST classifier with autograd. Build an CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) from a custom data set you acquire from images.google.com
##    using Pure Numpy (with unit tests) (1)
## 2. Build a CNN based image classifier (at least 3 - 5 categories) from a custom data set you acquire from images.google.com
##    using Keras,
##    Tensorflow (2a) ,
##    Pytorch Lightning (2b)
#  Extra Credits Done:
##    If you implement a new activation function, new optimizer and new loss function in this code.
##    If you create your own pooling layer

##    Added pooling layer, rmsprop optimizer, loss, patience, stride, momemtum,
##    tensorboard integration
## 3. Transfer learning with Keras
