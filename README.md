###Assignment_1 for the first assignment of the course


###Assignment2 for the second assignment of the course has two parts: 
##PART-1 has Hello_Image, Hello_Video, Hello_Tabular(Structured), Hello_custom
I used a different dataset for Hello_Custom and predicted

##Part-2 has AUTOML vision and time series forecasting
and end2end deployment of the model on an android application deployed over an android handset and classification was tested on image data using an image of dandelion flower



####All the SNAPSHOTS SHOW THE ENTIRE SET 

###Assignment2 has a video recording of setup  zoom_0.mp4

####Assignment3 



###Parta -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  Using pure Numpy to build a 3 layer neural network (with relu nonlinearity - this is different from the  2 layer i have provided in the colab in slide deck) to train on data - pick appropriate number of neurons in each layer and just use relu for non linearity.,





##Partb1 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use pure pytorch tensor datastructure to build the same - do not use the auto differentiation yet. ,





##partb2 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use the pure pytorch tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives,





##partb3 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use the pure pytorch linear modules etc.,. - high level primitives and build neural network,





##partc1 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use pure tensorflow tensor datastructure to build the same - do not use the auto differentiation yet ,





##partc2 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use the pure tensorflow tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives,





##partc3 -  3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output  - use the pure tensorflow keras  linear modules etc.,. - high level primitives and build neural network - make sure you use the Model subclassing
